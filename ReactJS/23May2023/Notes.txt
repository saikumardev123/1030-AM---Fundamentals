Component:

A react Component can be a function (recommended) / class that should have logic + ui. 

We decide to create a component when we want to provide some functionality.

ex:  implement a login page -> Login Component 


syntax: 


  function ComponentName(){

 // logic 

    return(
         <div>
                  <!-- html content -->
         </div>
    )

  }

React App Structure: 


React follows tree structure to form the components.

                  App  (data)


         Users           Products
