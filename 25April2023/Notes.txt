Function Expressions:

<html>

<head>

</head>

<body>

    <script>
        function f1(x) {
            x();
        }
        function f2(y) {
            y();
        }
        function f3(z) {
            z();
        }

        var m = function () { // function expression
            console.log("anonymous 2");
        }

        f1(m);
        f2(m);
        f3(m);

        m = null;
        console.log(m);

    </script>

First class functions:

If a function is treated as a first class citizen which means every functionality 
involves the functions.

In JS, since all the functions are first class functions, we get the following 
advantages,
1.Pass a function as an argument. 
2.Store a function a variable. 
3. A function can return another function.


Problem Statement: Map the first object keys to turn out to be second object keys.

{
    uid:'', 
    fname: '', 
    level1_manager: ''
}

// logic - mapping

{
    userId: '', 
    fullname: '', 
    manager: ''
}

IIFE: Immediately Invoked Function Expresions. 

If we have a requirement where we want a function to be executed 
only once and should not be available for invocation, then we 
can use IIFEs.

syntax: 

  (function(){
       // code
  })();

  Note: IIFEs can be called only once when the script is loaded. 

<html>

<head>

</head>

<body>

    <script>
        (function () {
            console.log("I am an IIFE");
        })();
        console.log("some code");
    </script>

</body>
