braille

embossed
Intended for paged braille printers.

handheld
Intended for handheld devices (typically small screen, limited bandwidth).

print
Intended for paged material and for documents viewed on screen in print preview mode. Please consult the section on
paged media for information about formatting issues that are specific to paged media.

projection

about formatting issues that are specific to paged media.

screen
Intended primarily for color computer screens.

speech

on aural style sheets for details.

tty
Intended for media using a fixed-pitch character grid (such as teletypes, terminals, or portable devices with limited
display capabilities). Authors should not use pixel units with the "tty" media type.

tv
